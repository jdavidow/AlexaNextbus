Amazon Alexa Skill to report NextBus info

2015-12-27: Created to share the skill; It's late, so I am not going to put more into this file just yet.  I created this using the example code from Amazon for writing simple Alexa skills, check that out and you can use these files.

Note:  The nextbus info is currently hard-coded in the skill code, making this inappropriate for release unless you live on my block in San Francisco.  You'll need to change the Bus System and find your stops.

Please email me with requests, code suggestions (I am new to Javascript/node.js) and ideas for configuring/runninng methods via voice.
